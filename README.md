# global-housing-price-prediction
### Background 
Housing related investment(like REIT and real estate) can provide attractive and stable investment returns over the past few decade. However, there are still a lot of risk involving when investing in housing. Therefore, we may want to know which countries have lower risk and higher expected return in order to make the smart decision to invest.

### Project Objective 
The purpose of this project is to answer the following question:
- Which country have versatile return for housing investment from 2012 - 2022?
- Which country have the hightest mean return for housing investmen from 2012 - 2022?
- What is the performance of investment for each country from 2012 - 2022?
- What features have predictive power to the housing price movement?
- What is the potential return and variability if using machine learning approach to help investment in housing?
- Is machine learning model perform better comparing to the baseline model?

### What have I learnt in the project 
- Start from making sure your data is clean and informative 
- Conduct your analysis based on different angle(desciptive/ predictive/ causual/ prescriptive/...)
- Always compare performance with baseline model
- Ask SMART(**S**pecific/ **M**easurable/ **A**ctionable / **R**elevant / **T**ime) question

### Further Question
- Can I use clustering to understand the price trend for different countries better?
- What if we are not trading quarterly but dayly or yearly?
- Should I impute the data to avoid information loss?
